# Title of the project :E-Ration Management System 

# Abstract :  The proposed system, "E-Ration  Management System" is an automated solution developed using HTML , CSS and SQL Server that aims to overcome the challenges of the existing manual ration shop system. The proposed system leverages technology to streamline the stock distribution process, improve transparency, and enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the ration shop system.  

# In the Proposed System, the employee can access the system for ration at any time and it is easy for them to use. This system enrolls each transaction automatically in to the database and the database is created using SQL server.  

# The proposed system allows stock providers to update stock availability information online, which can be accessed by cardholders. Cardholders are notified through in the system about the availability of stock items and the distribution dates, eliminating the need for them to physically visit the ration shop to check for stock availability.  

# The proposed system enables cardholders to register for a token online, based on the distribution  dates. This helps in avoiding overcrowding at the ration shops and ensures that cardholders can shop for their stock items in an allocated time slot, reducing waiting times and inconvenience.
